title: Development of Device
---

Development of devices includes development of GAgent and MCU.Only device accesses to cloud can the APP check and control the device remotely.MCU data can interact with Gizwits cloud through GAgent in Fig.

GAgent:The application program runs in the network access module(WiFi,GPRS) and enables module to access Gizwits server to upload and download data.

MCU:Micro Control Unit,device controller,such as single-chip microcomputer

# Tutorials for MCU Development

1.Download the serial communication protocol between MCU and GAgent.

2.After creating the project and setting datapoints of product,the serial communication protocol between MCU and GAgent will be automatically generated by Gizwits.Take Wechat Pet House as example to explain how to obtain protocol in Fig.

3.Based on the serial communication protocol between MCU and GAgent,finish the communication between MCU and GAgent by referring to the MCU programming from Gokit.Click here to check WeChat Pet House source code.

4.Gizwits provides the testing and debugging tools for device. Click here to check the Testing and Debugging Tools.

5.Gizwits provides manufacturers with the production test tool .Click here to check Production Test Tool.

6.Gizwits can manage and OTA update the MCU firmware.Click here to check MCU OTA Update.

7.Gizwits will provide the statistical analysis which is about the data generated from the interaction between MCU and cloud.Click here to check Statistical Analysis.

# GAgent Development

1.Gizwits has adapted to the dominant WiFi modules.Wi-Fi device can access to cloud by programming the firmware provided by Gizwits into Wi-Fi module.Click here to download WiFi Module Firmware.

2.The GPRS manufacturers collaborating with Gizwits have finished transplanting the GAgent.In other words,use the GPRS modules produced by Gizwits cooperators can access Gizwits cloud.

3.If developers want to access Gizwits cloud with systems like Android or Ethernet device,they can transplant the underlying driver of SDK(which is used to develop GAgent) provided by Gizwits.Click here to check the Module Redevelopment Document.

On the aspect of WiFi module, there have already been more than twenty domestic manufacturers to make compatibility with Gizwits. Moreover, all developers now can get the development library to develop adaptation.

# 5.First step: Download IoE Demo App

IOE demo is a debugging tool that is introduced by Gizwits for intelligent hardware. You can complete the Gokit binding, remote and other operations via IoE Demo App. And it can be used as a debugging tool for other intelligent hardware projects that are developed on Gizwits.

You can download and install IoE Demo by scanning the yellow QR Code on the manual, or enter the Gizwits Developer Center to download. Download Link.

In order to help developers obtain a better grasp on the client development skills, we have provided an open source version of IoE Demo. Download Link.

# 6. Second Step : Connect GoKit to the Internet

 GoKit is connected to routers and accesses the Internet in a wireless way via WiFi communication module. What we need to do is to tell the SSID and password of WiFi router to GoKit (it just like your new mobile phone need to input WiFi password), but GoKit has no keyboard and screen, so how does it do this? GoKit provides three types of configurations: AirLink 、WebConfig、 SoftAP. Next, we will discuss each of different configuration modes. You chose any one kind of them.

## 6.1. AirLink network configuration

The process of completing Airlink configuration is as the following: press the button to open the "Airlink" mode for device. After opening the device, it will continue to receive WiFi broadcast packets with the specific code. When connecting mobile phone to available WiFi network, the specified App (such as IoE Demo) sends the encoded WiFi network SSID and password for the broadcast. After the device receives that, it automatically accesses this WiFi network connection. If this connection is successful, the configuration is completed. Following a step by step to complete the process for GoKit accesses router to connect to the Internet via AirLink. (Note: AirLink configuration does not support the 5G WiFi network. Please use the traditional 2.4G WiFi signal.)

1. Smart phones enters into the "System settings" to access the available WiFi network nearby you.

2. Open the downloaded "IoE Demo" App, and click the "Add New Devices" in "Menu Bar" on the upper right corner of the home screen.

## 6.2. SoftAP network configuration

Because the AirLink configuration has a certain technical restrictions, GoKit support another configuring way —— SoftAP. To complete this configuration, change the WiFi module of GoKits to AP mode, and connect phone to GoKit. Moreover, send the available WiFi network SSID and the password to GoKit. After GoKit receives configuration information, it will automatically try to access the router. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Under the normal power supply for Gokit, press and hold [key1] until [RGB LED] turns red (Arduino baseplate [RGB LED] flashes blue light once), which indicates that GoKit has already been initialized. And GoKit that is under the initial state will automatically enter the “SoftAP” mode.

4. Wait for 30 seconds to one minute, and when the indicator light of WiFi modules on Gokit flashes alternatively, the configuration has been completed.

## 6.3.Web Config configuration mode

Web config is an upgrade of SoftAP configuration mode, which solve dependence problem that the intelligent hardware configuration access dedicated App. Implementation principles are similar with SoftAP, but directly using the browser that is provided by mobile phone can be completing the configuration. Concrete steps are as follows:

1.Under the normal power supply for Gokit, press and hold [key1] until [RGB LED] turns red (Arduino baseplate [RGB LED] flashes blue light once), which indicates that GoKit has already been initialized. And GoKit that is under the initial state will automatically enter the “SoftAP” mode.

2 Mobile phone enters the "WiFi settings" in the "System settings" to find "XPG-GAgent-XXXX" (XXXX is the last four character of your GoKit MAC address) and connect this WiFi network. If it need to input password, please enter: 123456789.

3 Open the browser on mobile phone, and enter "10.10.100.254" into the address bar to access the GoKit configuration page. According to the prompt, input available WiFi network SSID and password, and then click configuration.

4 Wait for 30 seconds to one minute, and when the indicator light of WiFi modules on Gokit flashes alternatively, the configuration has been completed.

# 7. The Third Step: Using IoE Demo to Control GoKit

After the completion of GoKit network configuration, GoKit has been connected to the Internet via the router, you can use the "IoE Demo" to view and control GoKit state (including LAN and remote).

## 7.1. Devices binding

To ensure that mobile phone and GoKit are connected to the same WiFi network, open IoE Demo, and refresh the device list so that you can find a new device that is not bound to “WeChat Pet House”, as shown below:

![](/assets/en-us/overview/GoKit/pic_017.jpg)

Click the device to make it automatically finish binding. If you have never registered, login IOE Demo, and GoKit will bind with the current mobile phone. Under the situation that you do not change your mobile phone, you can enjoy the device’s functions which includes state checking, remote control, and more. If you change your mobile phone, you need to finish binding again in the LAN. If you want to use different mobile phones to control GoKit, you can first register an account, and finish the binding after logging in it. After you complete binding, you only need to use the account to log in, so that you can use different mobile phones to process the remote control for GoKit.

## 7.2. LAN control devices

After the completion of binding, the device displays the “LAN online”. Click and enter the device interface, you can view the latest state of GoKit and carry out control operations.

## 7.3. Remote control device

Keep the GoKit connection, the mobile phone turn off the WiFi or switch to other WiFi network. At this time, the "IoE Demo” App will automatically identify the network environment and switch to remote connection mode.

# 8. The Fourth Step: Use WeChat to Control GoKit

From version 5.X, WeChat supports the device function of Services Account. By using WeChat to scan QR Code, you can follow the Device Official Account and realize the control of the device. As the initial technical cooperation partners, Gizwits also make GoKit has the WeChat control function. Nowadays, GoKit is the only one intelligent development board with good support for device functions. The concrete steps for using WeChat to control GoKit are as follows:

1. Open the specification that is provided bu Gokit to find one piece of white QR Code (This QR Code is unique to each device, please take good care of it):

# Gizwits Platform Overview
## 1. Introduction
The Gizwits platform is a one-stop intelligent hardware development and cloud services platform for individuals and enterprise developers that has been built by Gizwits company with many years of deeply rooting in the industries, as well as actionable insights. The platform provides capabilities ranging from products definition, device-side development and debugging, application development, production testing, cloud-side development, operations management, and data services etc., which cover full lifecycle services from intelligent hardware provision to operation management.

The Gizwits platform provides developers with self-service smart hardware development tools and open cloud services. With self-service tools for dummies, comprehensive SDKs and API service capabilities, the platform lowers the technical barrier for IoT hardware development, reduces R&D costs, accelerates products launch speed, and helps developers promote the intellectualization of products to better connect and serve the end consumers.

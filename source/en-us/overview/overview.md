# Gizwits IoT Cloud

## 1. Introduction

The Gizwits IoT Cloud is a one-stop intelligent hardware development and cloud services platform that has been built by Gizwits with many years of deeply rooting in the industries as well as actionable insights for individuals and enterprise developers. The platform provides capabilities ranging from products definition, device-side development and debugging, application development, End-of-line test, cloud-side development, operations management, and data services etc., which cover full lifecycle services from intelligent hardware provision to operation management.

The Gizwits IoT Cloud provides developers with self-service smart hardware development tools and open cloud services. With self-service tools for novices, comprehensive SDKs and API service capabilities, the platform lowers the technical barrier for IoT hardware development, reduces R&D costs, accelerates products launch speed, and helps developers promote the intellectualization of products to better connect and serve the end consumers.

# Device Connectivity

## 1. Connect your devices to Gizwits IoT Cloud rapidly

In order to let developers quickly grasp the process of device connection, Gizwits provides two guides to device connection for MCU and SoC schemes respectively based on Gizwits open-source development kit - Gokit. Both guides take the smart light as an example.

Note: It is not necessary to use Gokit for device connection.

* [Device connection for standalone MCU scheme](../quickstart/MCUScheme.md)
* [Device connection for SoC scheme](../DeviceDev/SoCScheme.md)

## 2. GAgent

GAgent is Gizwitsâ€™s hardware connectivity with the embedded system firmware that can operate in Wi-Fi modules, GPRS modules and PCs etc. Devices access Gizwits IoT Cloud through the GAgent. GAgent provides the communication protocol between cloud and MCU, so that, according to the protocol, developers can realize the communication between MCU and GAgent.

The main role of GAgent is data forwarding. It is a data exchange bridge among devices, Gizwits IoT Cloud, and applications (App).

In order to enable different communication modules to connect to Gizwits IoT Cloud, we provide multiple firmware downloading methods and debug log collecting methods for those modules to ensure that the GAgent firmware runs normally on the modules.

Note: Please follow the following steps when downloading firmware to modules, otherwise unknown errors will occur.
